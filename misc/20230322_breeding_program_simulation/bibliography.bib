  abstract = {The R-package MoBPS provides a computationally efficient and flexible framework to simulate complex breeding programs and compare their economic and genetic impact. Simulations are performed on the base of individuals. MoBPS utilizes a highly efficient implementation with bit-wise data storage and matrix multiplications from the associated R-package miraculix allowing to handle large scale populations. Individual haplotypes are not stored but instead automatically derived based on points of recombination and mutations. The modular structure of MoBPS allows to combine rather coarse simulations, as needed to generate founder populations, with a very detailed modeling of todays' complex breeding programs, making use of all available biotechnologies. MoBPS provides pre-implemented functions for common breeding practices such as optimum genetic contributions and single-step GBLUP but also allows the user to replace certain steps with personalized and/or self-written solutions.},

  abstract = {In a population in which generations overlap the improvement in performance in successive years resulting from a single year of selection is not constant, for the genes from a group of selected individuals may take many years to pass through the population. A formal method is developed for predicting responses and discounted returns from improvement in populations with overlapping generations including, if necessary, generations of multiplication of breeding stock. The method is based on a matrix which specifies the passage of genes between the different age groups and sexes. Simple matrix operations can be used to compute the proportion of genes in animals of both sexes and each age in the population at any time which derive from a group of selected animals at an earlier time. The response produced by these selected animals equals the product of their genetic selection differential and the proportion of genes deriving from them. Comparisons are made between responses predicted using this theory and the classical theory of uniform rates of response, and a method is given for computing the time lag of genes passing through the population. The results are extended to enable computation of discounted returns from improvement. {\textcopyright} 1974, British Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.},
