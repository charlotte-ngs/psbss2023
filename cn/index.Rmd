# Preface {-}
The material presented here is in part based on course notes from `r met$add("Goetz2014")`. The main goal of this part of the course is to transport a clear view of different concepts in the context of the pig breeding program in Switzerland. After this course, the students have a clear understanding of the terms 

* livestock breeding
* livestock production and 
* animal husbandry

The main focus of this part of the course will be on different aspects that are related to a breeding program in general. The different types of breeding programs will be characterized. Furthermore, the components of a livestock breeding with a scientific foundation and a focus on economic objectives. The scientific foundation is important, because we want to evaluate or to measure the success of our breeding program and this is only possible, if the breeding program is built on a scientific foundation. Also the economic objective simplifies the evaluation of a given breeding program. As a consequence, an economic objective allows to compare different breeding programs.
